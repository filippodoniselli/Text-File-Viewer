# Text File Viewer

**Excercising application to visualize .txt, .config, .xml, .json and .ini files chosen by the user**

I had built the app in two ways: WPF and Windows Form. The functionalities and graphic are nearly the same, but in WPF case I inserted FontAwesome icons inside the buttons.

Have a nice code!
